# Gibbs V.S. EM

In this experiment, we will mainly compare two different inference algorithms: Gibbs sampler and EM algorithm

## Experimental set up

### Dataset
* Yelp location only
* Gowalla

### Model
* Expo-MF with fixed location covariates or Expo-MF with random location covariates, whichever is better in experiment 1

### Inference algorithm
* Gibbs sampler initialized by EM algorithm.
* Gibbs sampler initialized by EM algorithm(mu only).
* EM algorithm
